# Traffic Lights toy

Once you've got a local copy of this ~package, (and if you have NodeJS and NPM set up) you can run `npm install` in the shell to prepare to run the code.  Then execute `npm start` and a browser window should open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the toy should load.

Back in the shell, you can press Control-C to end the hosting of the toy.

See README_original.md for more information.
