Two submissions:

AddTwoNumbers_submission1.py -- This solution is merely iterative.
                                (using AddTwoNumbers_7.py)
AddTwoNumbers_submission2.py -- This solution is recursive (recursively iterative).
                                (at first using AddTwoNumbers_8.py, which compiles correctly on my laptop, but not on leetcode)
                                (then using AddTwoNumbers_9.py, edited to use class/instance syntax more conventionally,
                                 that is, not using
                                  Solution.addTwoNumbers(Solution,list1,list2)
                                 but instead using
                                  solution = Solution()
                                  list3 = solution.addTwoNumbers(list1,list2)
                                )

self.py  --  Greg, from Noisebridge, wrote this as he was trying to illustrate various usages of class/instance/self.
