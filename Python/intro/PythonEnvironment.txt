Desire
======

I'd like to be able to have precise control over the "executable environment" (for lack of a better term) when executing python code.  For instance, I think, having control over environment variables and ~options.  Or, more specifically (if this is applicable), I'd like to be able to run previous versions of python3  (such as python3.2, ie python3.2.6) on code that was guaranteed to work with that version.


Things to re-look into
======================

autoenv
virtualenv
virtualenvwrapper

pyenv-installer

Trying to get virtual environments / etc working
================================================

I did this in my Kubuntu system while working on the Springboard entrance test.
(wrote these notes in a file named notes_for_pretest.txt)

Wanted to use some kind of environment program:
so I can run different versions of python (Python 3.2, 3.2.6)

(but maybe all I need to do is refer to the correct python at the top of the file AND have the appropriate version of python installed)
(I was having trouble / failures when installing python3.2.6:

Ran ./configure
Ran make
Ran make test

 but found the following

321 tests OK.
2 tests failed:
    test_ftplib test_ssl
4 tests altered the execution environment:
    test_logging test_multiprocessing test_threaded_import
    test_urllib2_localnet
29 tests skipped:
    test_bz2 test_codecmaps_cn test_codecmaps_hk test_codecmaps_jp
    test_codecmaps_kr test_codecmaps_tw test_curses test_dbm_gnu
    test_dbm_ndbm test_gdb test_kqueue test_msilib test_ossaudiodev
    test_readline test_smtpnet test_socketserver test_sqlite
    test_startfile test_tcl test_timeout test_tk test_ttk_guionly
    test_ttk_textonly test_urllib2net test_urllibnet test_winreg
    test_winsound test_xmlrpc_net test_zipfile64
8 skips unexpected on linux2:
    test_bz2 test_dbm_gnu test_dbm_ndbm test_readline test_tcl test_tk
    test_ttk_guionly test_ttk_textonly
Makefile:812: recipe for target 'test' failed
make: *** [test] Error 1


Next step (after fixing this) would be
  not this: sudo make install
  but this: sudo make altinstall
